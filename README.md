# Data Engineer Nanodegree Subproject
The repository contains the project information of the **Data Modeling with Cassandra** from Udacity Nanodegree 
**[Data Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027)**. Please refer to the 
course [website](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) for more details.<br/>

Project scenario: A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and 
user activity on their new music streaming app.<br/>

Project goals: Build a database using **Cassandra** and design data models based on the specific queries. Write an ETL pipeline 
to transfer and insert raw data (*CSV*) into database tables for analytic purposes.

## Business Process / Data Requirements
- Analytics team wants to understand **what songs** their **users** are listening to.
- Tables must be designed to support specific queries in Cassandra.
